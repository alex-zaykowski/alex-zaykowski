### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alex, a 22 y/o developer currently finishing up my CS degree in upstate NY. Check out my website (constantly a work in progress) or stick around a look through my repos. 

I'm always down to talk about music, movies, or some new technology/framework that just came out. Feel free to reach out to me if you want.

ðŸŒ± React, Three.js, Node.js
